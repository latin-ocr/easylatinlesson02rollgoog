LESSON XXXIX.
. LOOATIVE OASE.—Com·1nunn.

2⁷8. Some words not names of towns have a Locat-ive form
which is to be translated with at, in, or on (see ᾧ 273).

Most Latin words, however, have lost the Locative form,
and another case must be used to express the idea of at,
in, or on. 'Phe ease thus employed is the Ablative, accom-
panied by the preposition in. The ablative is then called
the Locative Ablative.¹ Frequent examples of this simple
construction have been given in previous loesons.
