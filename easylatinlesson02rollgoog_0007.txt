PREFACE.

 

ΙΝ, the preparation of this book the authors have aimed to
present the essentials, and only the essentiale, of Latin Grammar
in a clear and simple form. They have thought that most First
Latin Books attempted too much, and by a multiplicity of details
obscured the simple elements of grammatica] structure. It is not
necessary, it is not possible, to teach the whole Latin Grammar in
one year3 and =the pupil's further progress is rather hindered than
helped by burdening his memory and confusing his judgment with
etymological technicalities and syntactical subtleties. Especially
is this true of the first few Iessons, and these have been made as
easy as possible, in the belief that time is saved by slow progress
at the beginning. If the pupil feels that he is being carried on in
spite of himself through things of which he has no clear concep-
tion, discouragement, confusion, and failure are the almost inevi-
table results. He should feel that he is driving and not being
driven by his work.

The Lessons are so arranged that each one is complete ln itself‚
and none is so long as to require that it be divided.1n each
Lesson the forms to be learned are placed first, and followed by
the model sentence, which illustrates and emphasizes the principle
involved. ‘Then come Latin sentences illustrating the use of the
forms and the syntax, followed by the rule, which is an induction
from the sentences, and English sentences that afford practice in
the, application of the rule. Τὴε vocabularyis placed at the end,
and should be learned after the other work of the lesson'is done.

<In addition ‘to these general statements we may be allowed to
call attention ,to the following ε

The vocabularies are in all cases extremely: short, and itj is
expected that they will be thoroughly learned.
