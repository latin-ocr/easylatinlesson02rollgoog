The exercises consist in every instance of complete sentences,
The consideration of the passive voice and of the subjunctive
· mood is deferred until the pupil may be expected to be thoroughly
at home in his use of the active and the indicative.·

Conditioual sentences have been admitted only in their plainest
forms, and have been treated, not with a view to exhausting the
subject, but with an effort to make the distinctions clear.

Infinitives, gerundS, and supines are treated as verbal nouns.

Gerundives are treated as participles. Ι

'Phe Vocat-ive case is ignored except in masculine nouns of the
second declension.

The Locative case is recognized as having a distinct form and
use.

An attempt has been made to reduce syntactical rules to single
principles, e. q.. the ,Dative with adjectives is recognized as not
differing in principle from the Dative with verbs.

The Grammatical Introduction will serve to explain the terms of
grammar to such pupils as are not already familiar with them.

The Appendix contains the grammatical forms in full and a
summary of syntax for convenience of reference.

The connected reading exercises have been selected and prepared
with great care, and while they introduce words that will require
the puplil to refer to the general vocabulary‚ it is believed that.
grammatieal principles and forms are not used before they have
been explained in the lessons. In the few instances where they

are 'anticipated, they are provided for hy notes.
⁸ In conclusion: We have not attempted to do the work of the
teacher‚ but to work with him, — “Dem Lekrer soll nicht vorqeyrg'ffen
werden ; '' and we have tried to avoid falling into the condemnation
recently expressecl by an eminent American educational authority
in the following words: “ The ordinary text-book is still found, as

· years ag0, to presuppose deadness or incompetence on the instruc-

tor's part; stuffed with matter not only useless but in the way.'’
